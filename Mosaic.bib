The models and algorithms introduced in Flows in Networks are used widely today in the fields of transportation systems, manufacturing, inventory planning, image processing, and Internet traffic. The techniques presented by Ford and Fulkerson spurred the development of powerful computational tools for solving and analyzing network flow models, and also furthered the understanding of linear programming. In addition, the book helped illuminate and unify results in combinatorial mathematics while emphasizing proofs based on computationally efficient construction. Flows in Networks is rich with insights that remain relevant to current research in engineering, management, and other sciences.

abstract = {In the last step of the mosaic production chain, neighbouring and partly overlapping orthoimages of a scene are merged to one mosaic. This should be done in a way that the transition from one to another orthoimage cannot be seen. The production line of orthoimages consists of several steps, each of which can introduce a different appearance regarding geometry, radiometry and spectral properties to the resulting orthoimage. For mosaicking adjacent orthoimages, a path of lowest difference in a combination of criteria is searched in the overlap area of these images. The seamline is chosen along this path of maximum similarity. In this paper, criteria for such an optimal seamline in colour orthoimages are elaborated. The main requirements are on one hand high colour similarity of the images (mainly in hue and intensity), and on the other hand high texture similarity (in orientation and magnitude of image gradients). The specified criteria are formulated in the energy function of snakes. A snake is an active contour which moves through an image and changes its shape until a minimum of its energy function is found. We use two snakes that attract one another (twin snakes). In a hierarchical strategy, a proper seamline is delineated fully automatically. The potential of the method is shown with an example. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The combinatorial optimization literature provides many min-cut/max-flow algorithms with different polynomial time complexity. Their practical efficiency, however, has to date been studied mainly outside the scope of computer vision. The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed. The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan style "push -relabel" methods and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style "augmenting paths." We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts of image restoration, stereo, and segmentation. In many cases, our new algorithm works several times faster than any of the other methods, making near real-time performance possible.

abstract = {The mosaicking of orthoimages has been used to cover a large geographic region for various applications ranging from environmental monitoring to disaster management. However, existing mosaicking methods mainly focus on the generation of seamlines between two adjacent orthoimages. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on the use of a seamline network formed by a novel area Voronoi diagrams with overlap and the use of effective mosaic polygons (EMPs) to define the pixels of each orthoimage for the final mosaic. The generated seamline network is global based and is also optimized after refinement. It gives an effective partitioning for the regions of all orthoimages to form EMPs. The partitioning is unique, seamless, and has no redundancy. The algorithm is parallel, and the EMP of each orthoimage only has relation to orthoimages which have overlaps with it. It can ensure the flexibility and efficiency of mosaicking, without an intermediate process and independent of the sequence of the image composite. The experimental results obtained from the mosaicking of 40 color orthoimages demonstrate considerable potential for generating a seamline network automatically and effectively. This is extremely useful when a seamless mosaic is required to cover a large geographic region.},

This technique uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find a seam-line with the minimal objective function. Since a segment of seam-line with significant mismatch, even if it is short, is more visible than a lengthy one with small differences, a direct summation of the mismatch scores is inadequate. Limiting the level of the maximum difference along a seam-line should be part of the objective in the seam-line selection process. Our technique first determines this desired level of maximum difference, then applies Dijkstra's algorithm to find the best seam-line. A quantitative measure to evaluate a seam-line is proposed. The measure is defined as the sum of a fixed number of top mismatch scores.

@article{Yu2012,
abstract = {Image mosaicking is an important task in remote sensing due to the need for imagery with a greater spatial extent than provided by individual scenes. Merging of images requires the selection of a seam line within their area of overlap along which the scenes are merged. The seam line has a better chance of being invisible if it lies in regions where the images to be merged are very similar. The automatic detection of an optimal seam line is not a trivial task as it is difficult to find laterally continuous regions with high image similarity, and to identify image similarities when there are variations in the images, for example due to different illuminations or viewing directions, or shadow differences of tall structures. This article presents an automatic seam line location technique for remote-sensing images and achieves the following three objectives: to trace along the locations with minimal image difference so that the merged data set appears seamless; to avoid creating discontinuities within salient features within the images; and to ensure that the more accurate radiometric values that are associated with the least distance from the nadir point are better preserved in the mosaic image. Therefore, our method uses pixel-based image similarity measurement to choose the locations with high colour, edge and texture similarity; a region-based saliency map that is based on a human attention model to identify and avoid the areas with visibly dominant foreground objects; and location preference to encourage the seam line to lie as close as possible to an equal distance from the two nadir points of the images being merged. These measures are used as input to a cost function and the estimated costs are used to guide the tracing of the seam line in a dynamic programming algorithm. Our experiments demonstrate that the consideration of a combination of factors produces superior results to using just one or two of the variables as controls when merging high-resolution images containing complex structures.},

abstract = {Image mosaicking is defined as the registration of two or more images that are then combined into a single image. One of the most difficult steps in the automatic mosaicking of orthoimages is deciding where to place seamlines in overlapping regions. Based on millions of image pixels, existing seamline detection methods mainly focus on how to avoid crossing buildings that are higher than the ground, which results in parallax on the overlapping images. However, various data in vector format, such as vector roads plotted manually and precisely, have not been used to aid the selection of seamlines. This paper presents a novel approach using vector roads alone to generate seamlines, and describes its application to the automatic generation of seamlines for image mosaicking of the city of Wuhan, China. A representative seamline is extracted as follows. First, the skeleton of the overlapping region of adjacent images is extracted after the delineation of boundaries of individual images. Second, vector roads in the overlapping region are overlaid with the extracted skeleton to build a weighted graph G (V, E). Finally, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm is applied to find the lowest cost path from I to O, which refer to two intersections of adjacent image polygons, with the lowest-cost path being the seamline. This vector-based approach is typically more efficient than raster-based approaches. Experiments demonstrate the merits of the proposed approach especially when vector road networks are available. ?? 2012 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).},

abstract = {Intelligent seamline selection for image mosaicking is an area of active research in the fields of massive data processing, computer vision, photogrammetry and remote sensing. In mosaicking applications for digital orthophoto maps (DOMs), the visual transition in mosaics is mainly caused by differences in positioning accuracy, image tone and relief displacement of high ground objects between overlapping DOMs. Among these three factors, relief displacement, which prevents the seamless mosaicking of images, is relatively more difficult to address. To minimize visual discontinuities, many optimization algorithms have been studied for the automatic selection of seamlines to avoid high ground objects. Thus, a new automatic seamline selection algorithm using a digital surface model (DSM) is proposed. The main idea of this algorithm is to guide a seamline toward a low area on the basis of the elevation information in a DSM.},

abstract = {Parallax handling is a challenging task for image stitching. This paper presents a local stitching method to handle parallax based on the observation that input images do not need to be perfectly aligned over the whole overlapping region for stitching. Instead, they only need to be aligned in a way that there exists a local region where they can be seamlessly blended together. We adopt a hybrid alignment model that combines homography and content-preserving warping to provide flexibility for handling parallax and avoiding objectionable local distortion. We then develop an efficient randomized algorithm to search for a homography, which, combined with content-preserving warping, allows for optimal stitching. We predict how well a homography enables plausible stitching by finding a plausible seam and using the seam cost as the quality metric. We develop a seam finding method that estimates a plausible seam from only roughly aligned images by considering both geometric alignment and image content. We then pre-align input images using the optimal homography and further use content-preserving warping to locally refine the alignment. We finally compose aligned images together using a standard seam-cutting algorithm and a multi-band blending algorithm. Our experiments show that our method can effectively stitch images with large parallax that are difficult for existing methods.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of sensor manufacturing technology, high spatial resolution (HR) images are becoming more easily acquired and more widely used. However, it is common that a region of interest (ROI) cannot be completely acquired from a single image. Image mosaicking can resolve the problem by creating a new large-area image from multiple images with overlapping areas. A typical mosaicking procedure for HR remote sensing images includes three successive steps: tonal adjustment, seamline detection, and image blending. In this paper, we propose a robust mosaicking procedure featuring novel ideas in all three steps, which is aimed at processing HR remote sensing images of urban areas. Firstly, the tonal adjustment is realized by a local moment matching (LMM) algorithm, which solves the nonlinear photometric correlation problem between adjacent images. Secondly, an automatic piecewise dynamic program (APDP) algorithm for seamline detection is proposed to detect the optimal seamline on the overlapped area. Last but not least, we propose a cosine distance weighted blending (CDWB) method to ensure that the seamline is as invisible as possible. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method was proved to be effective in experiments with high resolution aerial and satellite images.},

abstract = {While mosaicking images, especially captured from the scenes of large depth differences with respective to cameras at varying locations, the detection of seamlines within overlap regions is a key issue for creating seamless and pleasant image mosaics. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to efficiently detect optimal seamlines for mosaicking aerial images captured from different viewpoints and for mosaicking street-view panoramic images without a precisely common center in a graph cuts energy minimization framework. To effectively ensure that the seamlines are optimally detected in the laterally continuous regions with high image similarity and low object dislocation to magnificently conceal the parallax between images, we fuse the information of image color, gradient magnitude, and texture complexity into the data and smooth energy terms in graph cuts. Different from the traditional frame-to-frame optimization for sequentially detecting seamlines for mosaicking multiple images, our method applies a novel multi-frame joint optimization strategy to find seamlines within multi-overlapped images at one time. In addition, we propose simple but effective strategies to semi-automatically guide the seamlines by exploiting simple human-computer interaction strongly constraining the image regions that the seamlines will or won't pass through, which is often ignored by many existing seamline detection methods. Experimental results on a large set of aerial, oblique and street-view panoramic images show that the proposed method is capable of creating high-quality seamlines for multiple image mosaicking, while not crossing majority of visually obvious foreground objects and most of overlap regions with low image similarity to effectively conceal the image parallax at different extents.},
